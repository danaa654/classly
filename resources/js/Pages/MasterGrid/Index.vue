/* ── Subject Sidebar live preview overlay ────────────────────────────
   subjectOfferings (from the server) only ever reflects faculty_assigned
   from the `teaching_assignments` table — i.e. whatever was actually
   Saved. That's correct once persisted, but it means the Subject Card
   still says "Faculty: —" the moment a block is placed on the grid via
   an in-progress Generate Preview or an in-progress inline Edit, even
   though the Timetable itself already shows a faculty name for that
   same offering.

   This computed overlays THREE still-unsaved sources onto the
   server-provided offering list, purely for display — it never
   mutates subjectOfferings itself and never substitutes for the real
   Save step:

     1. generatePreview.value.blocks with status 'preview' — a batch
        just generated, sitting in the Review modal, not yet applied.
     2. scheduledEvents.value entries with status 'preview' — set only
        for rows freshly merged in from a Generate Preview batch that
        hasn't round-tripped through the server yet (see
        applyGeneratedPreview() below).
     3. draftGroup.value — the meeting-day block(s) currently open in
        the Edit Schedule modal. Opening/editing that modal never flips
        anything to status 'preview' (that flag only ever applies to a
        fresh Generate batch, never to editing an already-placed
        block), so without this source the sidebar would keep showing
        whatever was last saved even while the modal has a different
        faculty selected right in front of the user.

   Whichever source names a faculty for a given subject_offering_id
   wins over the server's last-saved value; if neither source touches
   an offering, its server-provided faculty_assigned passes through
   unchanged. */
