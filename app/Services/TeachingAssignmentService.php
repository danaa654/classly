/**
 * Faculty Loading business rules.
 *
 * Eligibility to teach a Subject Offering is decided ONLY by:
 *   - Faculty Scope (general / departmental / cross_department)
 *   - Department match between the faculty and the offering's program
 *   - Subject Category (Major vs Minor)
 *   - The faculty's remaining unit capacity
 *
 * The old Faculty Subject "qualification" whitelist has been removed
 * entirely — there is no per-faculty subject list to check anymore.
 *
 * Each rule throws a ValidationException on failure instead of
 * abort_if()/abort_unless(). That distinction matters with Inertia: a
 * plain abort() produces a raw HTTP exception response, which Inertia
 * can't render as an inline form error — the user gets dumped onto
 * Laravel's full error page instead of a friendly message.
 * ValidationException is what Laravel's exception handler (and
 * Inertia's client-side handling) expects for a 422, so it comes back
 * as a normal validation error the page can display.
