/**
 * Greedy Schedule Generator — v2 (Intelligent Scheduling Engine).
 *
 * Produces an in-memory DRAFT/PREVIEW schedule for a single Section
 * (Department + Program + [Specialization] + Year Level + Section).
 * Nothing is persisted here — this service only computes and returns
 * an array of proposed blocks. Saving is a deliberately separate
 * concern (see MasterGridController::save()).
 *
 * ── What changed from v1 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * v1 required a Subject Offering to already have BOTH an assigned
 * Faculty (Faculty Loading) and a preferred Room before it could be
 * placed reliably, and any single unplaceable subject could make the
 * whole run look like it produced nothing. v2 never requires either:
 *
 *   Faculty — if Faculty Loading already assigned someone, we try to
 *   honor that first and only fall back to an automatic search if that
 *   faculty genuinely cannot take the slot (busy, overloaded,
 *   inactive). If nobody is assigned at all, we search automatically
 *   from the very start — same department -> qualified for the
 *   subject's classification -> lowest current load -> no conflict.
 *
 *   Room — the preferred Room (if any) is always tried first, but a
 *   fully automatic, type/program/capacity-compatible Room search
 *   always runs immediately after, in the same pass.
 *
 * Every subject is still processed independently and greedily (first
 * conflict-free combination wins, no backtracking, no reshuffling of
 * already-accepted blocks — see findPlacement()). If one subject can't
 * be placed anywhere, we record why and move on to the next one; we
 * never abort the batch. The goal is maximum subjects scheduled, not
 * an all-or-nothing batch.
 *
 * ── Why conflict-checking is in-memory only ─────────────────────────
 * There is no need to also query the `schedules` table here — Save
 * Schedule (MasterGridController::save()) re-validates the whole
 * preview against both the in-memory set AND `schedules` via
 * ScheduleValidationService right before committing. This service's
 * only job is to produce a good first draft; every conflict check here
 * is against the blocks generated within THIS SAME preview run.
 *
 * ── Multi-meeting subjects (meetings_per_week) ──────────────────────
 * A subject configured in Session Settings to meet 2x or 3x a week
 * produces MULTIPLE result rows here — one per meeting day, all
 * sharing subject_offering_id/faculty_id/room_id/start_minutes/
 * end_minutes, differing only in `day` — never a single row spanning
 * several days. This mirrors exactly how `schedules` now stores them
 * (see the migration making schedules unique on [subject_offering_id,
 * day] instead of subject_offering_id alone) and how the Master Grid
 * already renders/edits one block per row.
 *
 * Per spec, a subject's SAME faculty, SAME room, and SAME time-of-day
 * are used across every one of its meetings — day-combinations are
 * restricted to standard pairings (1x: any single day; 2x: MW / TTh /
 * WF / MTh; 3x: MWF or TThS), and placement only accepts a combo if
 * EVERY day in it is simultaneously free for that faculty/room/section
 * at the same start/end — see resolveDayCombos() and findPlacement().

     * already claimed the two available CCS faculty ahead of them.

     * eligible faculty is placed FIRST, while more flexible subjects
     * are deliberately pushed later — a more flexible subject has more
     * fallback options left over even if it goes last, whereas a

     *
     *   Departmental — belongs to exactly one college. Can ONLY teach
     *   Major subjects, and ONLY inside their own college. Never
     *   eligible for a Minor subject, anywhere, and never eligible for
     *   a Major belonging to another department.
     *
     *   Cross-Department — also belongs to one home college, but has a
     *   wider reach: can teach both Major AND Minor subjects inside
     *   their own college, AND can additionally teach Minor subjects
     *   belonging to OTHER departments. They are never handed a Major
     *   subject outside their own college.
     *
     *   General / GenEd — belongs to no department (department_id is
     *   null) and can ONLY teach Minor subjects, but across every
     *   department without restriction.
     *
     * In table form, for a Subject Offering belonging to department D:
     *
     *   | Scope            | Major (in D) | Minor (in D) | Minor (other) |
     *   |-------------------|:-----------:|:------------:|:--------------:|
     *   | Departmental (D)  |     YES     |      NO      |       NO       |
     *   | Cross-Dept (D)    |     YES     |     YES      |      YES       |
     *   | General/GenEd     |     NO      |     YES      |      YES       |
     *
     * A Major is therefore always restricted to Departmental/Cross-
     * Department faculty who belong to that exact department — never
     * General/GenEd, and never a Departmental/Cross-Department faculty
     * from a different college. A Minor is open to General/GenEd
     * faculty (any department) and Cross-Department faculty (any
     * department, including their own) — Departmental faculty are
     * never eligible for a Minor.
     *
     * Secondary ranking, once scope-eligible:
     *   1. Same department as the offering (helps a Cross-Department
     *      faculty's own-college minors edge out their outside-college
     *      minors, all else equal)
     *   2. Lowest current teaching load (live — includes everything
     *      already placed earlier in THIS run)
     *
     * Eligibility mirrors ScheduleRecommendationService::suggestFaculty()
     * so "who could teach this" never disagrees between the Greedy
     * Scheduler and the Interactive Review's suggestion panel — if you
     * change the rule here, mirror it there too.
