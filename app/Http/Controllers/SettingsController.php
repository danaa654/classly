/**
 * Settings > Scheduling Workspace.
 *
 * Lets Admin/Registrar point every scheduling module (Subject
 * Offerings, Faculty Loading, Teaching Assignments, Room Management,
 * Master Grid, etc.) at a Planning Academic Term that can be months
 * ahead of whatever term is currently Active — see
 * SchedulingWorkspaceService for the full Active-vs-Planning
 * distinction.
 *
 * Dean, Assistant Dean, and OIC can view this page (so they always
 * know which term the scheduling modules are currently pointed at)
 * but the update endpoint is restricted to Admin/Registrar, both by
 * route middleware (role:Admin|Registrar in web.php) and again by
 * UpdatePlanningAcademicTermRequest::authorize() as defense in depth.
 *
 * updateSchedulingWorkspace() is deliberately the single write path
 * for the Planning/Working Term — both the full Settings page AND the
 * Topbar's quick "Switch Working Term" dropdown submit here (see the
 * 'settings.scheduling-workspace.update' and 'working-term.update'
 * routes in web.php, which are two names for the same route/method).
 * That keeps there being exactly one place that ever calls
 * SchedulingWorkspaceService::setPlanningTerm().
