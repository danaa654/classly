 *

 *     (index()/sections()/show() below — unchanged).
 *   - Faculty Schedule: College -> Faculty -> weekly schedule
 *     (facultyIndex()/facultyList()/facultyShow() below), reading off
 *     TeachingAssignment (the Faculty Loading record) rather than
 *     Section, since a faculty member's weekly load is naturally
 *     organized around "who", not "which block".
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT another editing surface — Master Grid
 * already owns generating/editing/saving `schedules` rows, and
 * Teaching Assignments already owns assigning faculty to offerings.
 * This controller only reads.
 *
 * Same role group as Master Grid / Teaching Assignments — anyone who
 * can see the scheduling workspace has a reason to see a clean printed
