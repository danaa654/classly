     * for its subject_offering_id — the same column the
     * teaching_assignments unique index already protects).
     *
     * Eligibility to teach is decided purely by Faculty Scope +
     * Department + Subject Category (Major/Minor) — see
     * TeachingAssignmentService. There is no Faculty Subject
     * qualification list anywhere in this module anymore.
     *
     * RBAC: Dean and OIC are scoped to their own college — everything
     * handed down here (roster, assignments, offerings) is narrowed to
     * their department_id (plus General Education, which belongs to no
     * department and serves every college). Admin, Registrar, and
     * Assistant Dean oversee every department, so they see everything
     * unscoped — see managerDepartmentId().
